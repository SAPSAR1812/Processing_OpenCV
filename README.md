# Processing_OpenCV
Testing a couple of commands I found interesting for OpenCV. Among them is manipulating cell colour values both in RGB and HSV, Contours, Corner Detection, Filtering the image to decrease contrast and remove noise, filtering out the 'non-brown' parts of the image (to be used in a later project).
